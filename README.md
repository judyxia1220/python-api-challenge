## Overview

__Module 6 Challenge__

This challenge consists of two parts: 
1) _WeatherPy_:
    - This is the first part of the challenge where the Python script visualizes the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Information about the weather was generated from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). From here, we wanted to conduct an analysis to find the correlation between the different weather conditions (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed) and latitude (separated between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere). Scatterplots were generated to conduct the analyses to gain insights between these variables. 

   
2) _VacationPy_:
    - The second part of the challenge used information from the first part to identify cities with ideal weather conditions for future vacations based on conditions I had set within the code. [Geoapify API](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/) was used to identify the nearest hotels to the cities that had met the ideal conditions. We visualized the selected cities and hotels by mapping it out.
